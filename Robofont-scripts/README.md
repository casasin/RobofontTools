Some scripts related to selecting and deselecting stuff.

**Groups to Selection** script thanks to Josep Patau ([Tipo Pepel](http://tipopepel.com)).

### tools

- **SpaceCenterKernCheck** is also a extension though I’m not sure if makes sense if you can simply run this script and get the same. Check the *ReadMe.md* file in its folder for info about what it does.

- **scriptRunner** allows to run a previously selected script from a button window. Useful if you run often a script and don’t want to loose time navigating the menu to find it each time.
